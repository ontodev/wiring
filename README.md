# Wiring IRIs Nice and Good

Wiring is a collection of tools and conventions for working with globally unique identifiers.

Our plan is to provide a simple API that can be used from many different languages and platforms.

We aim to cover:

- IRI: URL, URN, URI
- Namespace and prefix maps
- QName: NCName
- CURIE
- RDF: JSON representation
- OWL: functional syntax, Manchester syntax
